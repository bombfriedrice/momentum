NBA Momentum - A Competitive Basketball Trading Card Game

NBA Momentum is an exciting basketball-themed trading card game built using NBA Top Shot moments, where each card is strategically powered by momentum-driven stats.

[Flow Integration]

NBA Momentum integrates Flow Blockchain to bring Top Shot moments into an interactive, competitive trading card game. We added metadata and game stats to existing Top Shot moments, allowing users to play using real basketball highlights with dynamic offensive, defensive, and strategic abilities. The project utilizes Flow’s API and smart contract functionality to store and update game data on-chain, enabling verifiable ownership and seamless gameplay.
